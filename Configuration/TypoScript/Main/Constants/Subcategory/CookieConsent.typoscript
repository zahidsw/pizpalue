We also use 'position' to assume the shape of your popup. If you specify 'top' or 'bottom', we assume that a full width 'banner' is required. If however you specify a horizontal direction, we assume that a corner popup is required (which we call 'floating').

        # cat=6060/1080/1230; type=boolean; label=Static Position: The popup uses position fixed to stay in one place on the screen despite any scroll bars. This option makes the popup position static so it displays at the top of the page. A height animation has also been added by default so the popup doesnâ€™t make the page jump, but gradually grows and fades in.

The Opt-In and Opt-Out options are not out-of-the-box solutions, manual adjustments to your software are necessary. For your support we provide the events bk2k.cookie.enable, bk2k.cookie.disable and bk2k.cookie.revoke. These events allow you to let your application react to them and to set or remove cookies accordingly. The cookie that contains the current status is called cookieconsent_status.
